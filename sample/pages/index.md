# Hello!
I am Aarush Gupta (also known by my internet pseudonym "0x44RU5H") an enthusiastic student, avid writer, and self-taught programmer. 

My hobbies include coding and writing, both of which I spend countless hours immersing myself in. I also find myself participating in sports, organized or not, during breaks from school or the weekends. Since my birthday falls near the springtime, I tend to like that portion of the year better than the others; however, I believe that I would find it spectacular even if my birthday did not occur during that season.

I have a [Github profile](https://github.com/0x44RU5H), where I often put code that believe can help others or allow others to build upon (granted they give credit to my work). I also find myself communicating with others through [Discord](https://discord.com/users/795838680282693704).
